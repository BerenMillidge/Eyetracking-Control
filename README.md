# Eye Tracking Interfaces
This contains tests for different methods of interaction with the computer via head/gaze tracking. It interfaces with the xLabs api to provide webcam-based head/eye tracking. 

Methods implemented are:

  * Head-based dwell-time selection,

  * Head-based gestures,

  * Head-based smooth pursuit selection,

  * The xLabs ants game reimplemented with head tracking,

  * Gaze-based dwell-time selection,

  * Gaze-based gestures,

  * Gaze-based smooth pursuit selection,
  
  * And any other ideas!
  
Requires the xLabs api!

The code was originally written in late 2018 so may be out of date with current APIs.
